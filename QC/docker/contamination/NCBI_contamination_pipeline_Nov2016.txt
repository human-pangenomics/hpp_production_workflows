NCBIÕs Foreign Contamination Screens, November 2016The purpose of the foreign contamination screens is to identify contaminating sequences that may be present for artificial reasons or for biological reasons.  Artificial reasons include cloning artifacts (vector, linker/adaptor/primer, E. coli host DNA), contamination in the lab with human sequence, mixing of samples or sequencing runs with other organisms, and bacterial insertion sequences that have integrated into sequenced clones.  Biological reasons include the presence of endosymbionts, infectious agents, or microbes residing on the surface of the organism or in the gut when the DNA prep was made.Our suite of foreign contamination screens uses BLAST to screen the submitted sequences against:1. a common contaminants database that contains vector sequences, bacterial insertion sequences, E. coli and phage genomes2. a database of adaptors linkers and primers3. a database of mitochondrial genomes4. the chromosomes of unrelated organisms5. a database of ribosomal RNA genesSuspect spans are re-BLASTed against:1. the chromosomes of unrelated organisms2. the chromosomes of related organisms3. the NCBI nt BLAST database of nucleotide sequence from all traditional divisions of GenBank, EMBL, and DDBJ4. the NCBI htgs BLAST database of sequences from the HTG division of GenBank, EMBL, and DDBJ Results similar to those obtained by NCBI could be generated by running the screens as described below.1. Common contaminant screen============================Databases---------a) File to screen for the common contaminants in eukaryotic sequences:ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/kitts/contam_in_euks.fa.gzContains the cloning artifacts that are likely to show up as contaminants across all eukaryotic species: vector sequences, E.coli genome, phage genomes, bacterial Insertion Sequences and transposons.b) File to screen for the common contaminants in prokaryotic sequences: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/kitts/contam_in_prok.faContains phiX174.These files need to be unzipped and the resulting FASTA sequence files formatted as BLAST databases using the makeblastdb program.Programs--------blastn and makeblastdb are contained in the blast+ package which can be installed following the instruction in the BLAST help documents."BLAST Command Line Applications User Manual": https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279671/"Standalone BLAST Setup for Windows PC": https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK52637/"Standalone BLAST Setup for Unix": https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK52640/Execution---------A BLAST search is run against either the contam_in_euks or contam_in_prok database, depending on the origin of the input sequences. The common contaminant BLAST results are filtered for hits over various length and percent identity cut-offs.Command line:a) for screening eukaryotic sequences:blastn -query _input_fasta_sequences_ -db contam_in_euks -task megablast -word_size 28 -best_hit_overhang 0.1 -best_hit_score_edge 0.1 -dust yes -evalue 0.0001 -perc_identity 90.0 -outfmt "7 qseqid sseqid pident length mismatch gapopen qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore" | awk '($3>=98.0 && $4>=50)||($3>=94.0 && $4>=100)||($3>=90.0 && $4>=200)'OR with an intermediate file, these 2 commands:blastn -query _input_fasta_sequences_ -db contam_in_euks -task megablast -word_size 28 -best_hit_overhang 0.1 -best_hit_score_edge 0.1 -dust yes -evalue 0.0001 -perc_identity 90.0 -outfmt "7 qseqid sseqid pident length mismatch gapopen qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore" -out _out_file_awk '($3>=98.0 && $4>=50)||($3>=94.0 && $4>=100)||($3>=90.0 && $4>=200)' _out_file_b) for screening prokaryotic sequences:blastn -query _input_fasta_sequences_ -db contam_in_prok -task megablast -word_size 28 -best_hit_overhang 0.1 -best_hit_score_edge 0.1 -dust yes -evalue 0.0001 -perc_identity 90.0 -outfmt "7 qseqid sseqid pident length mismatch gapopen qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore" | awk '($3>=98.0 && $4>=50)||($3>=94.0 && $4>=100)||($3>=90.0 && $4>=200)'OR with an intermediate file, these 2 commands:blastn -query _input_fasta_sequences_ -db contam_in_prok -task megablast -word_size 28 -best_hit_overhang 0.1 -best_hit_score_edge 0.1 -dust yes -evalue 0.0001 -perc_identity 90.0 -outfmt "7 qseqid sseqid pident length mismatch gapopen qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore" -out _out_file_awk '($3>=98.0 && $4>=50)||($3>=94.0 && $4>=100)||($3>=90.0 && $4>=200)' _out_file_2. Adaptor screen=================VecScreen (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/) is run against either the adaptors_for_screening_euks.fa database or adaptors_for_screening_proks.fa database, depending on the origin of the input sequences. Hits are filtered to retain only those matches that VecScreen classifies as "Strong" or "Moderate" (see: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/about/#Categories).Databases---------The adaptors_for_screening databases are available here:ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/kitts/adaptors_for_screening_euks.faftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/kitts/adaptors_for_screening_proks.faThese FASTA sequence files need to be formatted as BLAST databases using the makeblastdb program.Programs--------The VecScreen standalone program is available here:ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/demo/vecscreenThe script to filter the VecScreen results is here:ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/kitts/VSlistTo1HitPerLine.awkExecution---------Command line:a) for screening eukaryotic sequences:vecscreen -d adaptors_for_screening_euks.fa -f3 -i _input_fasta_sequences_ -o _vs_output_file_b) for screening prokaryotic sequences:vecscreen -d adaptors_for_screening_proks.fa -f3 -i _input_fasta_sequences_ -o _vs_output_file_Filter out the "Weak" and "Suspect Origin" hits:VSlistTo1HitPerLine.awk suspect=0 weak=0 _vs_output_file_ > _filtered_vs_output_file_3.

Ribosomal RNA screen=======================Ribosomal RNA genes are the cause of many false positives because the include some segments that align to distantly related organisms. Segments that match rRNA genes are identified so that such segments are not reported as being foreign.BLAST is used to screen the input sequences against a database of the rRNA gene sequences .Database--------ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/kitts/rrna.gzThis file needs to be unzipped and the resulting FASTA sequence file formatted as a BLAST database using the makeblastdb program.Programs--------blastn and makeblastdb are contained in the blast+ package (see above).Execution---------The BLAST hits to rRNA genes are filtered for hits over 95% identity and at least 100 bases long.blastn -query _input_fasta_sequences_ -db rrna -task megablast -template_length 18 -template_type coding -window_size 120 -word_size 12 -xdrop_gap 20 -no_greedy -best_hit_overhang 0.1 -best_hit_score_edge 0.1 -dust yes -evalue 1E-9 -gapextend 2 -gapopen 4 -penalty -4 -perc_identity 95 -reward 3 -soft_masking true -outfmt 7 | awk '$4>=100' > _filtered_mito_output_file_5. Foreign chromosome screen============================Screens for matches to chromosome sequences from foreign organisms. Foreign organisms are those that belong to a different taxonomic group compared to the organism whose sequences are being screened. The taxonomic groups are:   arthropoda, chordata, other_metazoa,   viridiplantae, fungi, other_eukaryota,   bacteria, archaea, viruses_and_viroids   Databases---------Our databases to detect cross-contamination detection are limited to assemblies that have been publicly released in GenBank/ENA/DDBJ and subsequently picked up by RefSeq. Genome centers can do better by augmenting these databases with additional genomes that they have sequenced but which are not yet represented in the RefSeq collection.a) archaeaQuery in Nucleotide : archaea[porgn] AND srcdb_refseq[prop] AND biomol_genomic[prop] AND complete[prop]b) bacteriaQuery in Nucleotide : bacteria[porgn] AND srcdb_refseq[prop] AND biomol_genomic[prop] AND complete[prop]c) fungiQuery in Nucleotide : fungi[porgn] AND srcdb_refseq[prop] AND biomol_genomic[prop] AND (NC_000000:NC_999999[pacc] OR AC_000000:AC_999999[pacc] OR (NT_000001:NT_999999999[pacc] AND ("chromosome 2L" OR "chromosome 2R" OR "chromosome 3L" OR "chromosome 3R")))d) arthropodaQuery in Nucleotide : arthropoda[porgn] AND srcdb_refseq[prop] AND biomol_genomic[prop] AND (NC_000000:NC_999999[pacc] OR AC_000000:AC_999999[pacc] OR (NT_000001:NT_999999999[pacc] AND ("chromosome 2L" OR "chromosome 2R" OR "chromosome 3L" OR "chromosome 3R")))e) chordataQuery in Nucleotide : chordata[porgn] AND srcdb_refseq[prop] AND biomol_genomic[prop] AND (NC_000000:NC_999999[pacc] OR AC_000000:AC_999999[pacc] OR (NT_000001:NT_999999999[pacc] AND ("chromosome 2L" OR "chromosome 2R" OR "chromosome 3L" OR "chromosome 3R")))f) other_metazoaQuery in Nucleotide : metazoa[porgn] NOT (arthropoda[porgn] OR chordata[porgn]) AND srcdb_refseq[prop] AND biomol_genomic[prop] AND (NC_000000:NC_999999[pacc] OR AC_000000:AC_999999[pacc] OR (NT_000001:NT_999999999[pacc] AND ("chromosome 2L" OR "chromosome 2R" OR "chromosome 3L" OR "chromosome 3R")))g) viridiplantaeQuery in Nucleotide : viridiplantae[porgn] AND srcdb_refseq[prop] AND biomol_genomic[prop] AND (NC_000000:NC_999999[pacc] OR AC_000000:AC_999999[pacc] OR (NT_000001:NT_999999999[pacc] AND ("chromosome 2L" OR "chromosome 2R" OR "chromosome 3L" OR "chromosome 3R")))h) other_eukaryotaQuery in Nucleotide : eukaryota[porgn] NOT (metazoa[porgn] OR fungi[porgn] OR viridiplantae[porgn]) AND srcdb_refseq[prop] AND biomol_genomic[prop] AND (NC_000000:NC_999999[pacc] OR AC_000000:AC_999999[pacc] OR (NT_000001:NT_999999999[pacc] AND ("chromosome 2L" OR "chromosome 2R" OR "chromosome 3L" OR "chromosome 3R")))i) viruses_and_viroidsQuery in Nucleotide : (viruses[porgn] OR viroids[porgn]) AND srcdb_refseq[prop] AND biomol_genomic[prop] AND (NC_000000:NC_999999[pacc] OR AC_000000:AC_999999[pacc] OR (NT_000001:NT_999999999[pacc] AND ("chromosome 2L" OR "chromosome 2R" OR "chromosome 3L" OR "chromosome 3R")))The FASTA sequence files resulting from these queries are formatted as nine BLAST databases using the makeblastdb program.Execution---------Repeats in the input FASTA sequences are soft-masked to lowercase using WindowMasker. Then BLAST hits over 98% identity are generated to the databases for the 8 taxonomic groups to which the organism being screened does not belong.blastn -query _input_fasta_sequences_ -db _distant_organism_dbs_ -task megablast -word_size 28 -best_hit_overhang 0.1 -best_hit_score_edge 0.1 -dust yes -evalue 0.0001 -min_raw_gapped_score 100 -penalty -5 -perc_identity 98.0 -soft_masking true6. First pass calls===================The following heuristic rules help to get rid of most false matches.Process contaminant matches from 1----------------------------------Contaminant matches from (1)  are merged if they are from the same class of sequence (VECTOR, E.coli, IS, PHG) and they overlap or are separated by 50 bases or less. If the total coverage of contaminant matches from (1) is >75% of the sequence length then flag the sequence as a contaminant to be excluded.If the contaminant is classed as VECTOR, E.coli, IS:.*, PERM:.* or PHG:* and the contaminant location is within 100 bases of the the start or end of the sequence (or gap is the sequence is not contiguous), or within 100 bases of another contaminant match that is at an end, flag the contaminant span for trimming.If the contaminant is one of the above, and the match is longer than 700 bases flag the contaminant span for trimming.Other matches may be false alarms. Treat them as suspect spans and reBLAST the hit span plus 10 Kbp of flanking sequence on each side against nr, HTGS, related and unrelated chromosomes (as described below).  Process contaminant matches from 2----------------------------------Flag all adaptor spans for trimming.Process mitochondrion matches from 3------------------------------------If the total coverage of mitochondrial matches from (3) is >75% of the sequence length then flag the sequence as being mitochindrial sequence to be excluded.Process unrelated chromosome matches from 5-------------------------------------------Ignore any matches to chromosomes from unrelated organisms that lie with a region identified as being rRNA genes from (4) (the spans matched in 4 plus 100 bases on both sides). These are likely to be false matches. Treat other matched spans as suspect and reBLAST the hit span plus 10 Kbp of flanking sequence on each side against nr, HTGS, related and unrelated chromosomes  ReBLAST against nr, HTGS, related and unrelated chromosomes-----------------------------------------------------------Spans identified a contamination suspects in the first pass, plus 10 Kbp of flanking sequence on each side (up to the end of the contig), are BLASTed against nr, HTGS, related and unrelated chromosomes  to generate additional data for calling contaminants to be excluded or trimmed.Databases---------chromosome databases (a) to (i) from (5) above.ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/nt.*.tar.gzftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/htgs.*.tar.gzExecution---------The suspect spans are BLASTed against each of the 10 databases.blastn -query _suspect_spans_plus_flanks_ -db _reblast_db_ -task megablast -dust yes -evalue 1E-9 -searchsp 1000000000 -perc_identity 98.0 -soft_masking trueProcessing the reBLAST matches------------------------------Automatically exclude sequence contigs that meet all the following criteria:>60% of length covered with foreign hits, or less than 200 bp that are NOT coveredEach contributing hits must be 100 bp or longer with identity >= 98%The best match to chromosomes from unrelated organisms is longer than the best match to chromosomes from the related organism group Some of the other hits may be reviewed manually.
